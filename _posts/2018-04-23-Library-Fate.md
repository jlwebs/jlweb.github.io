#### Why not make a no-delay trip on programming with wechat application?Library Fate!

  ####
life's very short,so in limited time,why not achieve something flicking in my head , let me give her a name :Libary Fate!

##### 
Chance is not everywhere at any time, 
#
catch the moments, 

express your like to him/her ,

let him knows it! 

and just wait him to reponse    (locating you, or something else to verify you)

then you'll receive 

`thank you` 

or 

luckily ` me too`
does it sound exciting?
then come with me noob ,from beginning to end!
