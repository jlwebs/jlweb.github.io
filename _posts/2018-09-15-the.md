I'm not as talented as you imagined,
	nobody will care your response and slips
		but I do,
	day and night
hold you in my arm
	util my heats fade away,
the guy in your eyes,
	is just be a illusion of emotion
no appearance,no motivation
		just keeping and avoiding finding the truth
life always donate like nature,
but we never reflect on ourselves,
one day , a knock may get to your door
,however it is a gift out of date,
none will be reconginized,
	when everything drop down its fire,
the world will not be the old one any longer,
	for me,
its just a mysterious and advenrural stroy,
	waiting for my tears.....

Once Before ,I'm so satisfied with a simple creation ,while a bit of sweet drink,however
now I do make it,the weak mink make me have no feeling on coding even though that're
a miracle momment for me to have such a opportunity ,everything's turnning rot,the spining
image from my mind began from the breakup of my heavy study-period,I gradually lost a bit more intrest
on it,though I'm still think that I'm fond of it,and so that I choose a relative major for my
college time in spite of my parants' hope,because this road is stopless,when your only interest
for funning turned different,this is a task ,with nothing unique comparing to other work,\
you need to finish tasks,you'll have plent of time,but you'll never be that passionate,the infinite
time makes you get into a horrible crack,some times you just wanna have a reset in my life 
express,looking for some quiet,however a behind rope scramming at you prevent me 
enjoying all of views,a street vedio-game that consist of our childhood is never be owned by
us,we try to capture the butterfly above,but to find useless.I used to be a pure guy ,
the reality escapting land once carried our hope and dream,is crashing little by little ,
I wonder why I'm changed so fast.This environment there is surrounded by yellow-light
sweet coffee,nice rythme and quiet hours, the man's heart gone with wind affected by
many other thoughts,complex and uncaptured,
